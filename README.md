# Pixi Quasar POC (pixi-quasar-poc)

Proof of concept showing a Pixi canvas in a Quasar app

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

Try playing around with the slider to see the speed change. Watch the frame rate.

If the Vite server isn't working for you, try removing the client port number from the HMR options of the Quasar config file. This setting is helps establish the socket connection when using Gitpod.io cloud IDE, and you may not need it in a different environment (such as your local machine).
